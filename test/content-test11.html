                        <p>Australian leaders like to claim, disingenuously, that a characteristic of the alliance with America is that Australia reserves the right to object, in a friendly if forceful way, with US policy or decisions.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thepunch.com.au/images/uploads/assange.gif" alt="He may already have been indicted by a secret US grand jury" width="470" height="270" /></p>

<p>No such objections have ever been publically expressed. It is time to test it.</p>

<p>An Australian citizen is in real trouble abroad. Julian Assange faces decades in prison in the US, which has an atrocious record for grabbing foreign suspects and holding them long years without trial.
</p>
                        <div id="more"><p>That Assange mistakes himself for an oracle when he&#8217;s just a rooster is irrelevant. Australia&#8217;s lack of support for him is total. It carries hints of payback and moralistic exulting.</p>

<p>Assange believes he&#8217;s been abandoned by Australia, which says it has no place to interfere in extradition hearings between other countries.</p>

<p>That is no doubt legally correct, but the Australian spokespeople on this matter, Julia Gillard, Bob Carr and Nicola Roxon, know Assange is facing the most ruthless prosecutorial office on earth: the US District Attorney, likely overseen in this case by its Southern District office in Manhattan.</p>

<p>This is the group that convenes grand juries in the absence of the suspect, parades unchallenged &#8220;evidence&#8221; before jurors, always wins indictments, and then sends its agents abroad to drag home Colombian drug lords or 9/11 terror suspects such as Khalid Shiekh Mohammad.</p>

<p>The US ranks Assange in this class. Waterboarding is nowadays off the menu in the US, but a foreigner such as Assange could easily disappear into a federal prison for years.</p>

<p>This is not the kind of justice that Australia, let alone America, should support.</p>

<p>Assange is holed up in the Ecuador Embassy in London, waiting to learn whether it will grant him asylum in order to avoid extradition to Sweden to face the rape allegations that emerged so uncannily and fortuitously for Assange&#8217;s enemies.</p>

<p>British police will arrest him the moment he leaves the embassy, meaning his immunity campout is no more than an attempt to buy time.</p>

<p>Assange fears the fix is in: once in Sweden, whether he is tried and found guilty of the sex crimes or not, the US will grab him to face trial under the 1917 Espionage Act for the mass WikiLeaks releases.</p>

<p>Britain, at this time, is following the orders of its own courts by agreeing to extradite Assange to Sweden. But it appears to regard the US complaint very differently.</p>

<p>Britain, also a victim of WikiLeaks, values its international standing too highly to be seen as a pawn of America, especially in what is clearly a free speech case; and the British public, whether they like Assange or not, would regard his forcible removal to the US as a dangerous attack on their sovereignty.</p>

<p>Assange fears Sweden is a mere stopover on his way to the US. It is widely believed that federal prosecutors in America have already held a secret grand jury and indicted him.</p>

<p>Julia Gillard has been careful to focus on the Swedish case, treating him as a sex suspect. Her government claims no knowledge of the US indictment. Bob Carr seems to think, wrongly, that the Swedish extradition might as well go ahead because the US would win an extradition application from Britain anyway.</p>

<p>Clearly, Australia cannot intervene in the Swedish extradition process now that the British courts have ruled it is legal. But it can insist that Sweden not extradite Assange to the US to face trial. It should also find courage to oppose the American pressganging of an Australian.</p>

<p>Assange knowingly distributed classified US material, some of which was published in the New York Times, and elsewhere. WikiLeaks was fascinating &#8211; especially the Moscow embassy staffer&#8217;s account of the Caucasus wedding. We all skimmed it. We are all complicit.</p>

<p>A question at a US trial would be whether Assange, as a blogger, enjoys the same First Amendment free speech rights of media organisations, which have not been prosecuted for reprinting the same material.</p>

<p>Assange, as a non-citizen, may not even be able to invoke First Amendment rights. But his biggest problem is that he is not a loveable character who would come off badly before an American jury.</p>

<p>The Americans have already got their man &#8211; Private Bradley Manning, the Iraq soldier who allegedly leaked the material. They don&#8217;t need Assange.</p>

<p>Australia&#8217;s silence diminishes us all. Whether Assange belongs in a Swedish prison remains to be seen, but he does not belong with America&#8217;s languishing drug lords and terrorists. </p>

			<p>Casting Assange to his fate appears to be a bipartisan effort - I&#8217;m not aware of the opposition pounding away at them on the issue.&nbsp; I guess one moral of the story is you should be careful with your dick if you&#8217;re going to pick a fight with the world&#8217;s most powerful nation but the whole Swedish rape/extradition conspiracy thing reeks of a public relation firm.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to see a careful analysis of that.&nbsp; Nevertheless I do think the Government is acting in a shameful manner on this issue.

			<p>Nick once again I say this. This isn&#8217;t the opposition&#8217;s problem. Gillard has a plate full of problems. This is one of it. The opposition can sit back and watch Gillard slowly destroy the ALP and why not? Did the &#8216;government&#8217; listen to Abbott and Australia about the carbon tax? Give and take and you get somewhere.

Nick is saying that the opposition supports the government&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>In other words, they would do exactly the same if they were in power.</p>

<p>So if the approach taken on Assange is a &#8220;flaw&#8221;, it is a flaw that applies to both sides of politics.</p>

<p>This shouldn&#8217;t need to be explained to you.

			<p>gobsmack and Nick just as a innocent bystander I don&#8217;t see why there even has to be a mention of the opposition. When the Coalition are in power and when they actually make that flaw that is the point to call them on it. The current situation is solely a Gillard government problem, to talk about the opposition is just a side track to muddy the waters and avoid the real issue which is that Gillard and Carr haven&#8217;t done enough for Assange an Australian citizen who is innocent till proven guilty.

			<p>@ Gobby. It shouldn&#8217;t be needed to explained to you that if you commit a crime overseas, being an Australian citizen is not a gold pass to freedom. Assange will get his day in court to prove his innocence, if he allows that court the chance but using piss poor excuses like this looks like running to me. </p>

			<p>@ Lawyer &nbsp; See my response to ATM - the Opposition is either failing to hold the Government accountable, or there is bipartisan support for the Government&#8217;s stance on the issue.&nbsp; We have a parliamentary system to protect us and if the Government is behaving badly and the Opposition fails to challenge it on the issue then it is a failure of Parliament as a whole.&nbsp; Of course the Government has primary responsibility but the Opposition cannot use that fact to justify sitting on it&#8217;s hands.

			<p>@ Lawyer from NSW all Gillards problem&#8230;. ummm errr it wasn&#8217;t Julia rubbing up the national interests of foriegn countries the wrong way. I&#8217;d say it is Assange&#8217;s problem. It would be a simpletons to think that somehow Julia Gillard has stepped in to stop what is every citizens right to consular assistance. From what we know he has never formally asked for it. Perhaps he might try&#8230; there ya go what a bright idea.

At no point in this or any other article have I posted anything supporting Assange.<br />
@Lawyer from NSW<br />
As anyone who has read Punch for any length of time would know, Against the Man regularly posts partisan attacks on the ALP.&nbsp; <br />
In that context, trying to make a political point by attacking an approach that apparently has bipartisan support really doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&nbsp; I hope that makes things clearer for you.

			<p>A people smuggler gets more support from this Government than one of our own. Shocking.</p>

<p>As a Labor Party member you must be so disolutioned with it all, the failure to produce a legal policy on Asylum Seekers, the frantic compensation handouts to everyone and everything to avert the disaster of the Carbon tax, the collosal job losses, the constant borrowing to pay for things like MRRT because the Mines won&#8217;t be working for 3 to 4 years hence, paying $31.4 million per Asylum seeker and $10 million to every Afghan whilst stealing the up and coming Aussies Medical Rebate for petty budget savings.</p>

<p>Seems like if you want any love from the Gillard Government, best not to be Australian.

			<p>I tend to agree, Corby, as a convicted drug felon is getting better treatment than this.<br />
Oddly, the two women who first indicated Julian, later revoked their story. So how  are they going to charge him when no complaint is pending?<br />
If they just want to question him, that can be done in the UK or here in Australia.<br />
So sucks for the man. That, and the US has too many secrets the world should really know about.

			<p>Pixie I would love to see a link on this revocation. I am sure that if the charges had no basis in complaint, the UK courts would not have given the extradition order in the first place.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Perhaps you sitting drinking Latte in Double Bay have better information than Assanges legal team in the UK and could do with this information you speak of. Forward it to them quickly so they add it to the defence.</p>

<p>He was in Sweden.&nbsp; He was involved with two women, apparently by consent.&nbsp; They found out about each other and suddenly there are allegations of misconduct.&nbsp; The prosecutors already determined there was no case.&nbsp; He left the country.&nbsp; After publication of the documents in question, suddenly these mysterious allegations come back, and apparently questions can&#8217;t be asked anywhere but Sweden, where there is some magical property that doesn&#8217;t exist in Britain - the magical ability to extradite people to countries that apply the death penalty and the country demanding the extradition does not have to provide any evidence of a crime.&nbsp; Also, Britain has a little more self respect and won&#8217;t simply bow to America.&nbsp;  What extraordinary good luck for the US that there were some convenient allegations that could be raised from the dead - and in a country that would easily bow to pressure!&nbsp; Miraculous.</p>

<p>If all the Swedes really want is to &#8220;question&#8221; him about condoms, then why won&#8217;t they guarantee no extradition to the USA?&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t they just ask the bloody questions in the UK, and if there is a case,&nbsp; then charge him and seek proper extradition to face the charges?&nbsp; If there is no deal with America, then that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem, should it.

			<p>KH, to be fair it is not only about condoms. There seems to be an allegation that he held a woman down and continued after she objected to him not using a condom; amongst a few other things. What I do find interesting though is one of the women has indicated she was molested on 2 seperate occasions. She allowed Assange back into her house several days after the first incident and he (allegedly) then molested her again. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I can&#8217;t understand why she would have allowed him back into her house after the first incident. That does seem a bit fishy to me.

There may be offences relating to electronic hacking into supposedly secure institutions from the US Government. There are allegations of rape being bandied about.

Similarly, if there are allegations, the way to test them is in court, not to try to get the Federal Government to intervene. The only role the Feds have is to ensure that one of our fellow citizens is treated humanely and fairly.

			<p>Assange and his followers believe he will be extradited from Sweden to the US. Is there one scintilla of evidence to support this claim?&nbsp; Does it even make any sense?&nbsp; Certainly, this article provides neither a credible explanation nor a shred of evidence for the claims.</p>

<p>If the Americans have any grounds to extradite Assange, why would it be easier to persuade the Swedes than their long-time friends and allies the UK?&nbsp; Do you seriously think the British care more about their international image than the Swedes?&nbsp; The Brits have fought with the Americans in two Gulf Wars, in Afghanistan, and are up to their necks in the Middle East.&nbsp; But no, they value their international image too highly to be seen as an associate of the US? Oh really?</p>

<p>And what about the actual prospective charges in Sweden?&nbsp; Assange has had his day, many of them, in court;&nbsp; he&#8217;s tested the full range of British legal opinion; and the law has ruled that he should return to Sweden for questioning on two sexual assault charges.&nbsp; Where does Assange get off avoiding questioning - is he too important, too prominent, to have to answer to the Swedish justice system?&nbsp; What about the rights of the women he allegedly assaulted?</p>

<p>I tell you what, Paul - if Assange ends up in Sweden, and if the Swedes then consider extraditing him to the US, you can fire up this column and reissue it.&nbsp; But right now, the issue is indeed about two Swedish ladies who may have been sexually assaulted, and Assange does have questions to answer about that.

Sweden has form; on request from the US they extradited a man to Egypt who was wanted for questioning in relation to alleged terrorism. As must have been known by the Swedish judges, he was then tortured. There is no way a British court would do this, the British security services, sure but not their courts. So the US District Attorney knows that Britain will not extradite him &amp; Sweden will. </p>

<p>As for what the US will do, they have form as well. Dr Bell for instance, a man who worked for the CIA by selling weapons to South Africa during the cold war. A US District Attorney is discovered this &amp; decided to make a name for himself.&nbsp; The CIA lied &amp; said they had nothing to do with it &amp; allowed the Justice Department to jail him. When he was released, on appeal because the Justice Department hid the fact they knew the CIA was lying &amp; threatened to reveal what he knew, he was assassinated. </p>

<p>It’s simple really, reveal stuff that gets ordinary soldiers killed &amp; you get a media award. Reveal stuff that embarrasses our masters &amp; they come for you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It would be a bit late to worry about it once he is in Sweden. Talk about shuting the gate after the horse has bolted.</p>

<p>As for the Swedish ladies, bah humbug. He had sex with both of them &amp; they were consenting, that is until he did not ring them back &amp; they realised that the other woman existed. Then all of a sudden they turn up at a police station after talking to each other about it. The fact that they spoke to each other means any evidence they can give is tainted. Swedish sexual assault trials are something like a Soviet era show trial. Proper cross examination of the complainant is impossible.

			<p>Given the allegations in Sweden had already been dismissed, whilst he was in the country and they had free access to him, it seems more than a little coincidental that they should suddenly reappear when the US want him for something else.&nbsp;  The UK won&#8217;t extradite to a country with the death penalty - and several in the US government have already been calling for it in this case.&nbsp; For the record, Australia doesn&#8217;t either - there would have to be a guarantee that no death penalty would be applied. </p>

<p>You can hardly compare Britain and Sweden in terms of diplomatic clout - its laughable to suggest that Britain would simply kowtow to the US every time they snap their fingers - you seem to be confusing them with our government.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter how many times this is pointed out, but you still haven&#8217;t quite understood - there are NO charges in Sweden.&nbsp; They want to &#8216;question&#8217; him.&nbsp; He has not been &#8216;charged&#8217; with anything.&nbsp; In Sweden, from what I understand, they could charge him in absentia - so why haven&#8217;t they?&nbsp; There were no objections to questioning him in the UK - so why didn&#8217;t they?&nbsp; If there was a case, then they could charge him.&nbsp; Of course, then they would have to have a trial - this could take months - that is probably why they haven&#8217;t charged him now, because its not about these allegations - its about getting him to Sweden.&nbsp;  Why does he physically have to be in Sweden to answer questions?&nbsp; There can only be one reason - the US can&#8217;t grab him in the UK - they need him to be in Sweden, where a compliant and spineless government will happily hand him over. I&#8217;ll bet money that if he were sent to Sweden, the allegations would disappear forever, there will be no trial, and he will be in the US within a month.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I don&#8217;t particuarly like the guy - he seems like an arrogant twat,&nbsp; and I have never looked at his website.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t like the hypocrisy that allows him to be persecuted, but not any of the newspapers that  made the story &#8216;news&#8217; - how many people look at wikileaks?&nbsp; Would you even have heard of it if it hadn&#8217;t been all over the papers?&nbsp; The US already have the person who (allegedly) stole the documents in the first place.&nbsp;  I also don&#8217;t like how the government of this country (and it wouldn&#8217;t matter if Abbott was the PM - in fact, he would be helping the US more) just bends over and lets the US have its way, every time.

			<p>I absolutely agree Marley.&nbsp; I think Assange has done everything in his power to confound the two issues.&nbsp; Nevertheless I do think the Government should be making it clear to Britain, Sweden, the US, and us that they are carefully following the case to ensure that he isn&#8217;t being placed on an extradition conveyor belt. The US has a poor record when it comes to protecting the rights of non-citizens, and I say this as a lover of the nation, someone who spent large slabs of their childhood living there, who worked there for many years, and still has family over there. It will be too late to fire up this column if Assange is already on his way.

			<p>Good points, Marley.</p>

<p>MarkS, I do not see what those observations, some of which seem more like conjecture than established fact, have to do with Assange? The US is not going to try to extradite Assange to Egypt, for example.</p>

<p>KH, there are a lot of claims and counter-claims going around about these complainants, the prosecutor and Swedish justice in general. Usually, these sorts of matters are adjudicated via a legal process known as a &#8216;trial&#8217;. I would rather await the outcome of any such trial, assuming there even ever is one, than speculate.</p>

<p>I have suspected for some time that Assange&#8217;s real concern is that the Swedes might hold him on remand, rather than keep him on bail. That way, if an extradition request came from the US, Assange would not be able to escape to Russia (or, as it has transpired, Ecuador) to avoid it. This seems to be the only explanation that makes sense, given all the facts.</p>

<p>Of course, Assange has rendered this merely academic with his most recent antics.

<p>&#8220;The Brits have fought with the Americans in two Gulf Wars, in Afghanistan, and are up to their necks in the Middle East.&nbsp; But no, they value their international image too highly to be seen as an associate of the US? Oh really?&#8221;</p>

<p>The British do have form for kowtowing to the US.&nbsp; Look up an incident that Geoffrey Robertson talks about in his book &#8220;The Justice Game&#8221;.&nbsp; It&#8217;s in the chapter &#8220;Friendly (sic) Fire&#8221;.</p>

<p>In the last days of the first Gulf War, two US combat aircraft deliberately, or recklessly, bombed a tank column of British troops.&nbsp; Close combat regulations were in effect and there wasn&#8217;t an Iraqi trooper within fifty miles.&nbsp; Nine British troops were killed as a result.&nbsp; The families were told the deaths occurred due to the &#8220;fog of war&#8221; by the UK government, and that it was in &#8220;under pressure in a fast-moving battle&#8221;.&nbsp; These were deliberate and knowing lies.</p>

<p>The families of the 9 servicemen demanded, and eventually got, a coronial inquest over the matter.&nbsp; The UK government put as much pressure as could be imagined to stop the inquest or get an &#8220;open&#8221; finding on the deaths.&nbsp; The US government, for its part, thumbed its nose at the coroner&#8217;s court and would not even release the two pilots responsible to testify from the safety of a video link in the US.&nbsp; It instead sent a USAF colonel to sit and watch proceedings&#8212;with 2 military police next to him.&nbsp; The finding was eventually one that agreed with the families: that the 9 servicemen were killed by reckless and negligent behaviour by their two &#8220;allies&#8221;.</p>

<p>You can find a summary of the incident halfway down the page here: <a href="http://mysongbook.de/msb/songs/b/bofvicwi.html">http://mysongbook.de/msb/songs/b/bofvicwi.html</a></p>

<p>If the British are prepared to do that to their own people, why wouldn&#8217;t they sell out a foreign national to the US?

Now he is stuck in the Ecuador embassy and even if granted assylum is facing a life time in Ecuador.Not a very good poker player that&#8217;s for sure.

Would seem to me Mackell is being hung out to dry least Carr, Roxon and Gillard set some kind of precedent for Assange. That is the only explanation I can think of as to why Mackell&#8217;s not had any mention at the same time as they attempt to defend their Assange position.

Exactly, the problem is he isn&#8217;t getting this.<br />
There is a large amount of hypocricy sourounding this issue. America seems to have taken the stance that only Americans are entitled to their rights, there is no case to answer (the allegations were withdrawn) for Assange in Sweeden so why do they want to extradite him, why is no support being offered by the Australian Government (such as legal advice or even allowing him to stay at the Australian embassy). <br />
Nothing special, just what any Australian overseas is entitled to stemming from the responsibility of the Government to it&#8217;s citizens.

<p>I assure you, if it were you in the same situation,&nbsp; the Australian High Commission would not be paying for your lawyers, nor would it be housing you in its basement.&nbsp; It would be providing you with a list of lawyers, and notifying your family back home that you&#8217;d been busted. At most, it might be making a mild expression of interest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and perhaps sending a junior officer to monitor the hearing (though even that would be a stretch).&nbsp; You would be paying for your own lawyer, and relying on the local legal system, not the Embassy.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what happens abroad.</p>

<p>That all that embassies can do in foreign jurisdictions; moreover, in a country with a strong legal system like the UK, that&#8217;s all they should do.

Legal advice does not mean free legal advice.<br />
Also statements by the PM that amount to condeming Assange (yes it has occured) with no trial are out of line. Particularly as they do support those who have already been convicted and make pleas for clemency on their behalf.

			<p>@Al -sorry, but you are entirely mistaken.&nbsp; When you travel abroad, you are subject to the laws of the foreign country.&nbsp; You cannot expect to have diplomatic immunity, which is basically what you&#8217;re describing.</p>

<p>So no,&nbsp; an Australian citizen doesn&#8217;t have the right to seek asylum in the Australian Embassy.&nbsp;  If you get busted in Thailand for drug trafficking our pedophilia or simply public drunkenness, you  are going to have to deal with the local legal system.&nbsp; I can assure that if you try to claim &#8220;asylum&#8221; in the Embassy, the security guards will be showing you the door pretty damn quickly. </p>

<p>And no, Embassies do not provide legal advice, free or otherwise.&nbsp; Do you seriously think that Embassies are staffed by lawyers trained in the laws of the countries in which they are posted?&nbsp; The only people qualified to give legal advice are those who are members of the Bar of that country, not Australian diplomats with degrees in history or international relations.</p>

<p>Your whole argument is based on a complete misapprehension about Embassies and their role.&nbsp; Embassies are not there to provide legal advice;&nbsp; they&#8217;re not there to interfere with the host country&#8217;s legal system;&nbsp; they&#8217;re not there to protect you from being questioned or prosecuted over an offence committed in that country.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you want the kind of protection you seem to think an Embassy ought to provide, you will need to become a diplomat and acquire diplomatic immunity.&nbsp; And even then, if you do something serious they&#8217;ll hand you over to the local authorities.

If you are in an embassy you can&#8217;t be removed by the local police without the consent of the embassy.<br />
They can certainly grant that when you have been accused of a crime, but may also refuse.<br />
When I refer to legal advice I include being refered to appropriate people who can provide that advice about the local legal system.<br />
An Australian can seek protection at the embassy, it is then up to the embassy (and by extension the Government) to decide if they will grant it.<br />
If you don&#8217;t get to the embassy then they can&#8217;t do anything other than make pleas to the local Government that can be freely ignored.<br />
So if you broke the law in that country they are likely to hand you over, when the country asks.<br />
In this case as it stands he hasn&#8217;t broken a law in Britian and it would be Sweeden who would have to seek to have him handed over.

<p>And I&#8217;m saying that you&#8217;re wrong. Before you go abroad again, you might want to read the little brochure that comes with your passport, or read the Smart Traveller website, where it states, quite explicitly, that Embassies cannot &#8220;provide legal advice;&#8221; &#8220;intervene in private court proceedings or legal matters;&#8221; &#8220;get you out of prison or seek special treatment for you;&#8221; or &#8220;provide physical protection or security advice.&#8221; </p>

<p>Assange has had access to the highest level of the British courts and has lost his case.&nbsp; Ball game over.&nbsp; He has to go to Sweden.&nbsp; At the moment, he&#8217;s in default of his British bail conditions and of that order to return to Sweden.&nbsp; His problem at the moment is first with the British legal system, not the Swedish.&nbsp; And there is no way the Australian High Commission should or indeed could provide the kind of protection from the workings of the host country&#8217;s legal system that you seem to expect.

			<p>Australia (Julia, or whoever represents this country) will always bow down to America, because America isn&#8217;t a fair country. You can&#8217;t sit down with the USA and have a normal conversation without them getting offended. So Australia will always &#8220;Yes USA, sure USA, whatever you say USA&#8221; because they have a bigger Airforce, Navy and Army than us and will most likely put us on the top of their &#8220;hit list&#8221; if we challenge them in anything they do.</p>

<p>Julian IS a HERO. Anyone who says otherwise, doesn&#8217;t know what a true hero is. Heroes don&#8217;t have to save babies from fires or pull people from car wrecks&#8230; Heroes stand up for what is right, as a true selfless act. Julian put his life on the line for the human race (No one else in this country has ever done that) so that we can know the truth about the corruption, the extortion and downright evil workings of not only the US government, but our very own government, behind our very backs.</p>

<p>The Australian government is just as guilty as the US for so many crimes against humanity; no wonder they don&#8217;t want to step in and help out one of our own citizens in trouble.

			<p>@John L - two women have made allegations of sexual assault. The Swedes wish to ask him questions about the alleged assault. The highest court in the UK says he has to go back to answer those questions.&nbsp; Are you saying that he shouldn&#8217;t have to answer those questions - that neither Sweden nor the two women have a right to some answers?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Would you say the same thing if the accused was a football player or a Lib politician?&nbsp; Does he get a free ride just because he&#8217;s Julian Assange.?

			<p>America has changed so much in a short period of time.</p>

<p>When the Watergate scandal broke, the journalists involved were praised for exposing the truth of a corrupt government. Now those same journalists are condemned. The journalists in the Watergate scandal didn&#8217;t get their information without being sneaky, why is this different?</p>

<p>America has become a communist state.</p>

<p>Drones fly over U.S. cities to spy on citizens.</p>

<p>Phones and internet are tapped and internet freedoms being stripped all the time.</p>

<p>New York has turned into a police state.</p>

<p>There are calls to make protesting illegal.</p>

<p>They invade other nations at will.</p>

<p>Citizens can be locked up indefinitely without charge or trial and without the right to see a lawyer.</p>

<p>The CIA have admitted creating profiles on known activists and have began charging them before crimes have been committed (remember the case of the activists who had staged hundreds of protests over a number of years without incident, that got arrested before the G20 summit with Molotov cocktails being planted in their houses).</p>

<p>America is now a country at war with itself and its own citizens. America has done a lot of good and I for one see it as a shame that a country that once represented freedom and liberty has now become the exact thing they preached against for so long.</p>

<p>The even greater shame is that we Australia, a supposedly independent nation follow them without question.

			<p>Paranoid nonsense from start to finish and I expected better from Paul Toohey. </p>

<p>Firstly, Assange is no hero. Secondly, he should return to Sweden to hear the charges against him. Thirdly, he is not the subject of any extradition request to the States.</p>

<p>Finally, what the hell should Australia do exactly - send the SAS to extract him from Britain?</p>

<p>Assange, despite his delusions of granduer and the bleatings of his sycophantic and paranoiac anti-US cheer squad, is still subject to the same laws as everyone else when he travels beyond our borders. He should return to Sweden, face his accusers in court and the Australian government can consider how to assist him if and when he is ever the subject of a US extradition request.

He firmly believes, to the point of every body thinking him to be insane, that his actions were saving his country from an Islamic Invasion.<br />
Right or wrong it certainly got some attention. Assange parallel.<br />
Exposing combatant tactics however factual will certainly give the enemy a positive advantage. Free speech then becomes extremely unaffordable.

At first I was not interested in the rest of your ignorant comments, but since you have made an issue of it.</p>

<p>It is any person’s right in criminal law in Australia, the UK, Sweden or the US, not to answer questions about crimes they are alleged to have committed.</p>

<p>He has NOT been accused of rape, sexual assault covers a wide range of activity, and not everything is rape.</p>

<p>The US would have much greater problems removing him from the UK then Sweden. </p>

<p>If all they wish is to ask questions, which he is allowed not to answer should he wish. Then why do they need him on Swedish soil? </p>

<p>I do not disagree with your first, second &amp; last sentences. Which is not quite the same thing as agreeing.</p>

<p>Happy now?

			<p>Well said, Muxxx and others. Assange has distributed information that is more likely to embarrass governments than the public at large. Gillard&#8217;s devious evasions of her government&#8217;s responsibilities come as no surprise, especially when we have all cringed at her fawning, childish exaltation of Obama and his politics at global events which deserve a decorum unknown to her. On the other hand, Carr continues his willful way with heavy braggadocio, confidently presuming US, Swedish, Fijian, PNG, North African and other national intentions with all the gritty aplomb of a long-discarded product of Macquarie Street.

			<p>Assange must have been aware that the USA would not be happy especially when he published names. To late now for him to be worried about that, he should have thought before he acted. But to my knowledge, he has not been charged with anything in the USA. If the Yanks want him, they will get him no matter where he is, you only have to look at Bin Ladin. He needs to be a man and face those sex charges, this all about him trying to squirm his way out of it. If those 2 women think they have been wronged, they deserve their day in court. He had little or no regard for the people who in good faith that he would not run, put up his bail. That to me is a mark of his character, he is narcissistic , totally full of himself.

<p>What is the Australian Government supposed to do?? Maybe they could follow the previous LNP government and copy how they allowed Australian citizens to be treated by foreign powers. Not many in the press complained about that from what I recall.

			<p>If he was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 the below maximum penalties would possibly apply</p>

<p>It made it a crime:</p>

<p>&nbsp;   To convey information with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the armed forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies. This was punishable by death or by imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   To convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies when the United States is at war, to cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or to willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States. This was punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or both.</p>

<p><br />
So yes if he was hypothetically charged under this he faces decades in prison.</p>

<p><br />
But seriously when will people get it through their heads that he hasn&#8217;t been charged with anything in Sweden he is being extradited for questioning not to face charges

			<p>There is a lot of speculation, as well as a number of unsupported claims, in this article. However, my ultimate problem with it is this: if the US can make a prima facie case that Assange breached its laws, why should Assange not face a trial there? And, even if Australia repatriated Assange, what would be stopping the US from seeking his extradition from here?</p>

<p>I agree that, if the US snatched Assange and held him in some secret torture dungeon, Australia should kick up a fuss. As it stands, however, that has not happened. I also do not see it as especially likely, in the circumstances.&nbsp;  In the absence of any such melodramatics (except for Assange&#8217;s own) the Australian government is handling the situation appropriately. </p>

<p>And, while I agree that Julia Gillard should have kept her mouth shut about whether Julian Assange has breached any laws, it is hardly the first time she has said something that may well not be true.

			<p>Julia may have erred in making commentary about Assange but her doing that is still not as inappropriate, damaging and downright dangerous as the Liberal Party&#8217;s running commentary on Hicks, Habib and Haneef. In all three cases the Howard government found them guilty without evidence or a fair trial and publicly crucified them. In the cases of Hicks and Habib the government knowingly allowed two of its citizens to suffer inhumane treatment and torture at American hands. The Gillard government should have learnt from this, regardless of our personal feelings about Assange we should be demanding that at every point there should only ever be evidence driven action and that at all times Assange be treated respectfully and with dignity. I personally find Assange to be quite an unlikeable man and have absolutely no problem with him facing trial for whatever he is legitimately accused of, but the Australian government should stand up and demand transparency and integrity in the process.

You have no doubt breached the laws of many countries. Say Saudi or North Korea? Ever had a drink, do you have a picture of the dear leader on your wall? Why should they not be allowed should they wish to extradite you &amp; have you face a trial there? </p>

<p>The laws that the US wish to charge him under are so wide that in theory any journalist who writes something that the US Government would prefer you did not know can be killed. Abu Garbi? Telling us about it was in theory punishable by death. So should the editors and reporters of the Age, Australian &amp; Sydney Morning Herald should be extradited &amp; face death?</p>

<p>Manning was a US soldier who broke US law. Assange is the reporter he told it to, but because he is not part of News Corp, Fairfax or the like, the US believes they can make an example of him. Wikileaks is the new style internet version of old style investigative journalism. The hypocrisy of this is shown in that it was publications like the Sydney Morning Herald that published their secrets to the masses, but they have not said anything about going after old style newspapers. </p>

<p>Governments love to make it illegal to tell us about their dirty linen. Both major Australian political parties are showing their true colours in relation to this matter.

			<p>MarkS, unlike in your examples, Assange&#8217;s actions have a connection to the United States. In your cases, any breach of law is merely hypothetical or notional.</p>

<p>I agree that arguments about whether Julian Assange is a journalist could be quite important at any possible trial. I suspect the matter will turn on whether the act of leaking information qualifies as being part of the &#8216;the press&#8217;. One of the problems for Assange, in that respect, is that WikiLeaks is simply a source of information. Unlike a journalist, WikiLeaks does not write articles or analysis.</p>

<p>Indeed, WikiLeaks partnered with traditional media outlets, like the NY Times, in order to enable the information it had to become actual news. </p>

<p>Another aspect of the case may be the extent to which Assange conspired with or induced Bradley Manning to release the relevant information, rather than just receiving it. If he simply received the data one day, he could presumably argue that he was under no obligation to keep it secret.</p>

<p>Anyway, they are just my thoughts. And, at this stage, it is all entirely speculative as the US has not even sought Assange&#8217;s extradition.

			<p>This article would be a lot stronger if it explained exactly what any other Australian citizen could expect and which is being denied to Assange.</p>

<p>It would be even stronger if it explained that the secret Grand Jury procedure in the US was something sinister and different to what is normally done.</p>

<p>The problem for Mr Toohey is that, if he did that, the whole thesis of the article would collapse in a steaming heap, because what has happened in both cases is exactly and precisely NORMAL.</p>

 A big insult to all the men and women who have been brutally raped&#8230;.....

I am disgusted at our government, not doing everything to protect one of its own,&nbsp; And it is shameful that he has to go to the lengths to seek asylum in Ecuador, while the Australian government sits idly by,&nbsp; <br />
Also are the soldiers who fired on the the innocent civilian in Iraq, put forward by Bradly manning, also getting persecuted like Julian Assange,&nbsp; probably not,&nbsp;  <br />
Why are These so called Democratic goverments afraid of the truth, The internet has become a threat to Goverments of the world and they will do whatever they can to to silence any opposition towards them,&nbsp; <br />
Didn&#8217;t we learn from Wilkileaks cables, that Mark Arbid was in talks with America about sacking Kevin Rudd, a year before the Midnight sacking of an elected by the govenment PM,&nbsp; And It was suggested to America that Julia Gillard would be more compliant with America,&nbsp; <br />
Our standard of Journalism in Australia is very poor indeed,&nbsp; We need more journalist with a lot more intelligence logic, and better personalities, most bore the life out of me. Also I have stopped watching the Drum, and Insiders, they really need to get more talented journalist on these shows

			<p>Assange is all sorts of idiot but he has the same rights as any other Australian citizen. He also has to be accorded the same rights as anyone else facing similar charges.<br />
There are some - shall we say &#8220;interesting&#8221;? - aspects to his situation which do no add up. The rape allegations, the apparent collusion of the complainants, the dropping and then reinstating of them after he had legally left the country, an international arrest warrant for &#8220;questioning&#8221; which could be done in another location are all unusual.<br />
If he wants to spend the rest of his life in Ecuador then so be it but we should not believe he has been afforded any real assistance by the Australian governent. I would not put my faith in them either.

			<p>As an expat I can honestly say that when it comes to looking after its people overseas Australia really is the bottom of the barrel, Even for simple things such as lost passport is an absolute nightmare. Our systems just aren&#8217;t equiped to handle it. I had my passport stolen last year and I am several thousand kilometers from the nearest embassy. I needed a birthcertificate, but to get a birthcertificate you must apply to the BDM in Asutralia. My original email took 3 weeks for a standard reply. I had to send them original ID of several different forms strangly enough it was almost the same amount of ID I would need for the passport. Problem is in China you cannot send ANY mail without a passport. My mother couldn&#8217;t even get a birthcertificate from them in the end I had to sign over power of attorney to her and use a friend and his passport to get what ID I had to her. Then theres the passport. I had to go to beijing. BUT you can&#8217;t fly or travel by train without a passport. SO that involved another round of red tape from the chinese government this time just be allowed to get on a train. <br />
The embassy rarely even answers its own phone and on their website they detail on their services page more things they can&#8217;t do for you than can. My American friends here enjoy a completely different service, its almost a one stop shop for accurate advice and help, from disputes with visa officials and employers right down to custody battles the Americans really do look after their people. <br />
Same can be said Chinese nationals overseas. When a major disaster happens they are very quick to ship out  consular officials, providing food, money, accomodation and free travel home. <br />
Amoung expat Aussies the Australian Embassy is not only completely useless in many cases but a hinderance.

			<p>For Heaven’s sake, the US justice system is not a Gulag Archipelago. From rules of evidence to extensive rights of appeal, defendants are afforded far more due process there than perhaps anywhere else on Earth, including in Australia. And the grand jury system, with all of its flaws, is an additional check on prosecutorial discretion absent in the Australian system. But all of this talk about the US justice system is a canard; if the Obama administration wanted to extradite Assange, it could have done so while he was in the UK&#8212;as Toohey say, the US already has its man. Meanwhile, Assange has been given consular assistance, has been put up in a country estate and had his bail paid by celebrity leftists, which he has now forfeited. It’s past time that Assange return to Sweden and submits himself to justice there like everybody else. But if the Ecuadorian media-controlling, freedom-hating government wants to grant Assange faux asylum, I for one would enjoy the irony. There are two women in Sweden, however, to whom a measure of justice is owed. And I am sorry, but I am not complicit in the leaking of confidential information because I read about it in the NYT.

			<p>Habib and Hicks were picked up in the UN sanctioned post September 11 invasion of Afghanistan, to remove a fascist regime protecting Bin Laden, and held as illegal combatants. Until very recently, they would have faced summary judgement and execution under the Hague Convention, the laws of war and customary international law. That they are free today rather proves my point. But we digress. Assange is under investigation by Sweden for sexual assault, simple as that.

			<p>It&#8217;s incredible that our government see fit to intervene when a teenager is caught with drugs in Bali, to the point the the foreign minister actually rang him personally on the phone, but won&#8217;t intervene in this most serious of case of freedom of speech. We seem quite happy to interject in Indonesia&#8217;s business and deny due process, but won&#8217;t afford the same to a citizen such as Assange, who, when it comes to the US, has only exercised freedom of speech and nothing else. The double standards of this government are breathtaking.

			<p>Thats because the Government will never get much backlash from other countries for defending the idiot drug traffickers.</p>

<p>But the US wont be happy with Gillard if she went around defending Assange, hence why drug traffickers get a lot of help from the Govt when caught overseas but they would let Assange rot before they lift a finger to help him.</p>

<p>Pretty disgusting, personally i&#8217;d be abandoning all the drug smugglers bringing crap into our country and defend people like Assange, the ones who actually deserve some defense.

			<p>There&#8217;s just a tiny bit of difference trying to negotiate with a government like Libya which has an abysmal record on human rights and legal processes, and dealing with someone undergoing a legal process in the UK.&nbsp; Assange, unlike the lawyers in Libya, has had full access to a transparent court process.

			<p>I love the hypocrisy and opportunism of some of our writes today.&nbsp; It’s great fun.&nbsp; Personally, I blame the carbon tax for Julian not putting the rubber on in the first place.</p>

<p>It is not up to the Australian Government to prove Julian Assange’s innocence or for the taxpayer to contribute to his expenses.&nbsp; He, his mother and supporters, has to do that.&nbsp; In my opinion so as to further maintain the morale high ground, he has to go to Sweden and work it all out with them.&nbsp; If the US then tries to abduct him the story will change, however in Ecuador, he becomes just another accused criminal hiding out.</p>

<p>A soon forgotten and disgraceful affront to democracy and free speech is what the American financial multi-nationals have done to destroy Wikileaks and the Assange&#8217;s defence.&nbsp; Here we have American globalised financial monoliths, which we, as a sovereign nation, have allowed to monopolise our electronic payments industry, could, at the flick of a switch, stop a free person (for the moment anyway) from contributing to Wikileaks, if he/she wanted to.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the globalised world, this power is available to a few non-elected organisations and for me, goes beyond the rights of any company.&nbsp; The use of these tools in this way disappointed me about Clinton and the Obama administration, as I expected this type of action from the likes of a Nixon far right administration and not from a Democrat Government.&nbsp;  For those that do not know it was the Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal (wholly owned subsidiary of eBay) and Western Union that decided that you could not support Wikileaks and therefore what causes you are allowed to donate to going forward.&nbsp; Get used to it!!

			<p>I just saw 60 minutes last night, and was shocked to see the agreement between the US and Australian government discussing the lack of prosecution of US troops (referring to the rape case in Japan by a US serviceman of an Australian woman, and how the exact same laws exist here).</p>

<p>The problem is, we have a big brother (the US) who we rely on for protection in the region. In return for this protection, our big brother appears to have the right to buggery of our population.</p>

<p>Allowing our big brother to bugger our people appears to be the price our leaders have accepted, in order to stay safe.</p>

<p>I think in Shrek the line is something like&#8230;&#8220;Some of you may die, but it is a price I am prepared to pay&#8221;.</p>

<p>Isnt it nice for our leaders to hang our citizenry out to dry?</p>

<p>Julia, you disgust me. </p>

<p>We both know JA will get smashed every which way from sunday by the jerks in the US. There is no procedural fairness, Guantanamo should have told the world everything it needed to know by now.

			<p>In September 2009 my son, unfortunately found himself on the wrong side of the law in the US due to the pure association of some people he didnt even know, spent 7 weeks in custody (being moved in and out of upto 5 different facilities in that time) without charge. He still doesnt know why he was held for so long despite his repeated attempts for an explaination from the US Govt. While there he had limited contact with the Australian Embassy and the most assistance he received from the was that they ensured that he was given gluten free meals while in prison! Gee thanks Australia, you might want to find out why he&#8217;s inside and try and perhaps seeing your way clear to get him out! Oh, no we can do that, came the reply, we cant get involved in the laws of another country. We can just make sure his rights arent infringed. So you mean that your quite happy to let him stay there WITHOUT charge as long as his rights arent infringed and he can have a gluten free meal? Yes. <br />
So, in short, NO the Australian Govt will not help you if you find yourself in trouble overseas. They will not attempt to establish whether or not your deserve to be there and they will not ask any question of the foreign govt that is holding you or your family member with regards to how long they may be detained without charge because they dont want to step on any toes, especially the US. God forbid we should upset the Americans! <br />
He ended up being deported after neary 8 weeks in custody without charge and no explaination. No thanks to our Govt. He has no criminal record in the states but he still cant enter the US for 10 years! for what?

			<p>NHJ, I&#8217;m sorry your son was caught in this mess but you acknowledge that the Australian government ensured his rights weren&#8217;t infringed and ensured that he had a diet which would not exacerbate a medical condition. Legal assistance is his responsibility and yours if you choose to assist your no doubt adult son, not the governments. The govt quite rightly did not interfere with the legal process in another country and within 8 weeks the matter was resolved and he was sent home. Maybe you would be better off telling your son that he has an obligation to himself t pick his associates far more carefully in the future. I doubt very much that he wasn&#8217;t aware of what these associates were up to, if not before this mess, then afterwards, that would have been the subject of any questioning him during the course of his imprisonment.

			<p>No, he doesnt deserve better. Assange styles himself as a &#8216;world citizen&#8217;, treats Australia as a convenient back up nanny when times get tough but otherwise treats this country with contempt. Demanding assurances that he will not be extradited, will get to serve any prison term in Australia instead of the U.S, will get preferential treatment makes it sound as if this guy had diplomatic immunity. He didnt, he never has and never will. Spare us the &#8216;poor suffering Australian overseas&#8217; line. It didnt work with Hicks and it wont work with this egomaniac either. To date he has had a level of financial support and legal defence (Robertson, Khan etc) most defendants could only dream about.
